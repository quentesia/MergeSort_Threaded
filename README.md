# Multi-Threaded Merge Sort in C

## Overview

This project implements a multi-threaded merge sort algorithm in C, designed to sort an array of complex numbers. The implementation utilizes the pthread library to create multiple threads, allowing for parallel sorting of the array. The performance of the multi-threaded version is compared against a single-threaded implementation to demonstrate the benefits and challenges of parallel sorting.

## Features

- **Multi-Threaded Sorting**: Utilizes multiple threads to sort large arrays concurrently.
- **Complex Number Handling**: Sorts an array of complex numbers based on their magnitude.
- **Performance Measurement**: Measures and compares the execution time of both multi-threaded and single-threaded sorting.

## Requirements

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- pthread library
- math library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
